# Snake_Game
A basic little snake game built with python's turtle module. 

If you have installed python you can download the files and run "main.py".

If you don't have python installed or if you don't know what to do, you can simply download and launch the "snake.exe" file on your PC (Windows only). 

The snake.exe file was created using the "Pyinstaller" module on the python files.
